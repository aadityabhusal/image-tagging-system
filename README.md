### How its done?

When the user clicks on the image, a text box appears. When the user starts to type:

1. The usernames get fetched from the database and showed in a list

2. When a username is clicked, the clicked position and the userid gets stored in the DB.

3. When the 'x' mark is clicked, the tag record gets removed from the database.
